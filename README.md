# üöÄ MERN Login & Signup Form Project

Welcome to our MERN stack project! This project is a simple yet powerful login and signup form built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to register for an account, log in, and access protected resources.

## Features

‚úÖ User Registration: Users can sign up for a new account by providing their name, email, and password.

‚úÖ User Authentication: Registered users can log in securely using their email and password.

‚úÖ Secure Password Storage: Passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database to ensure user data safety.

‚úÖ User Feedback: Informative messages provide feedback to users during the registration and login processes.

‚úÖ Backend API: The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for user authentication and registration.

## Technologies Used

üîµ MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information securely.

üü¢ Express.js: A Node.js web application framework used to build the backend server and API.
